title:  "Recommend two blogs"
---

I would like to recommend two blogs. The authors maintain high standard of
writing contents. They pick up not-easy topics and deliver them well. 
For those who are interested in go and docker/k8s, I recommend you to have 
a quick read.

The first one is [Quasilyte blog](https://quasilyte.dev/blog/). The author's 
topic is go compiler. Last November, I was trying to solve a bug in `cmd/compile`,
I have figure out the SSA format in a few days. Although my solution cannot
universally remove inline SSA marker, I still learn a lot.
But later I encountered with this blog, and I had wished I found it earlier.
The author illustrates the SSA of go in a very clear way: details, examples and 
his understanding. Later he's post on `gogrep` is also a good piece. Anyone
who wants to get into this world, just go and read it.

The other one is [iximiuz](https://iximiuz.com/en/). Both authors are writing 
in English and the original posts are in Russian. This author gives great overview
from 5,000 ft high to 3 inch low on docker and orchestrations. I learn PTY, 
docker container layer, and the orchestration system.
